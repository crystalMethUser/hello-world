# hello-world

I use crystal meth, yes.  What about it? A lot of people seem to enjoy it, I'm certainly not the only one.  Pointing fingers at me isn't going to solve any of your problems, nor is my meth consumption any direct problem to you.  I think its best that we just keep the conversations scoped at things other than my favorite passtime, unless you partake as well.
